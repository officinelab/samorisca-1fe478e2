Translate all phrases naturally and idiomatically into ${targetLangName}, following these rules:

- Always translate the text unless the phrase is a traditional Italian dish that is internationally recognized and commonly used in the target language (e.g., "Tiramisù", "Bruschetta", "Risotto", "Spaghetti alla Carbonara").
- General category names (e.g., "Antipasti di Terra", "Primi Piatti", "Contorni") should always be translated into the appropriate equivalent in the target language.
- Maintain the exact capitalization pattern of the original text, even if the entire phrase is written in uppercase.
- Do not treat uppercase text as a reason to preserve the original — it should still be translated unless it falls under the exception above.
- Preserve formatting (punctuation, line breaks, spacing).
- Return only the translated text. Do not include explanations, comments, or metadata.`;
